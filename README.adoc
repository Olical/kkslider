An extremely simple slide show plugin for Neovim. The only reason it's restricted to Neovim is because it's built with https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed] which is also only supported in Neovim.

It takes a single AsciiDoc file as input and splits it up into individual slides for each top level heading (a line beginning with a single `=`).

Once opened you can use `<left>` and `<right>` to navigate through the slides.

== Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, mine is https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] but any will do.
